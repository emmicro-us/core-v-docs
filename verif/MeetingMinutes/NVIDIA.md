Attendees:
----------

**OpenHW:** Mike Thompson <br>
**NVIDIA** Joe Wang, Eric Liang, Wenjing Song

Actions:
------

**Mike** to work with OpenHW team to integrate NVIDIA team into GitHub and MatterMost discussions.<br>
**Eric** to share "2.0" feature spreadsheet with Mike.  This will be published on GitHub.

Topics:
-------
1. Due to internal project constraints, this was the first meeting between NVIDIA and the OpenHW Verification Task Group in some time.
2. The NVIDIA team has determined that they will develop a "2.0" version of their instruction stream generator and would like to understand if there is sufficient interest from OpenHW to use it in [core-v-verif](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-verif).
3. Version 2.0 of the NVIDIA generator will update several key features:
- User Documentation
- Code Structure
- Maintenance
- Performance
- Features<br>
Work on 2.0 is expected to start in October 2020.  The NVIDIA team is open to considering specific input from OpenHW to the above feature list.
4. There was a good discussion about how to staff this project.  NVIDIA would like to engage with OpenHW on this project.  Mike explained that the best way to that was to attend the bi-weekly VTG strategy meetings and get set-up on MatterMost, particularily the [ISG Channel](https://mattermost.openhwgroup.org/all-users/channels/twg-verification-isgs)

**OpenHW:** Mike Thompson <br>
**NVIDIA** Neo Fang, Wenjing Song, Lesliex

Notes:

Actions: Mike

Topics:
--------

1. Open Action Items:

- (Closed) **Neo**: example testbench to run core-v-isg.
- (Closed) **Mike** to forward a couple of useful formal verification papers from Oski Technologies.
- (Closed) **Neo** to investigate the effort required to port the NVIDIA instruction set generator for 32-bits.
- (Closed) **Mike** to send out an agenda 2 days ahead of time.

2. Additional questions about the NVIDIA ISG.

* Mike asked about the effort required to create a 64/32-bit version of the NVIDIA ISG.
  * Neo estimates this would be about 2 to 3 weeks of effort for an engineer already familiar with the code.
* User Manual:
  * A User Manual is planned, but NVIDA cannot commit to a specific delivery date.   Effort to generate the document is ~2wk.
  * Mike will review the "NEED_CHANGE" comments in the `riscv_base_seq` to see if he has any questions about controlling the generator.
* The INVIA sub-division of Thale has seen core-v-isg and wants to know if it supports MMU, cache, interrupts and all RV ISA extensions (M, C, A, M, D, etc.).
  * MMU is not explicitly supported
  * Cache is not supported
  * the NVIDIA ISG will generate code for interrupt handlers, but the testbench is required to drive interrupts
  * RV64IMCF extensions are supported
  * User and Supervisor modes are supported

3. Example testbench:

- Thanks to Neo for generating this so quickly.
- Mike has updated the dsim.mk Makefile and successfully run the example using Metrics DSIM
ACTION: **Mike** to update xrun.mk to allow Cadence Xcelium users to run the example.
- Mike and Neo briefly reviewed some of the code.

4. NVIDIA contribution to OpenHW CORE-V verification.

- Rick O'Connor has issued a "call for participation" to execute verification of the CV32E40P as soon as possible.
- Mike has developed a detailed project plan that requires 4 FTE engineers to complete the task by 2020-09-25.
- How can NVIDIA contribute to this effort?
ACTION: **Mike** to arrange a meeting with NVIDIA leaders to discuss.

**NVIDIA** Neo Fang, Doris Yin, Eric Liang, Wenjing Song

Actions: Neo, Mike

Topics:
--------

1. Open action items:

- CLOSED: **Mike:** to create a set of slides and present in our next meeting (see CORE-V Overview for NVIDIA team below).
- CLOSED: **Neo:** to create a "vcs.mk" to support compiling with Synopsys VCS.
- OPEN: **Neo:** has made some progress creating example testbench to run core-v-isg.  Still working on it.

2. CORE-V Overview for NVIDIA team:

- Mike gave a status [presentation](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-docs/blob/master/verif/Common/Presentations/20200512_OpenHW_Verif_Status.pdf) to the NVIDIA team.
- Neo had several questions about OpenHW plans for Formal Verification.  The detailed plann is captured in the [Formal Verification](https://core-v-docs-verif-strat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formal.html) chapter of the CORE-V Verification Strategy.<br>
ACTION: **Mike** to forward a couple of useful papers from Oski Technologies.
- The current plan of record for the CV32E40P is to use the Imperas Instruction Set Simulator (ISS) as the reference model for the core.  Using a Spike model will require additional effort (it is possible, just not part of the plan).
- Mike informed the team that users of the Imperas ISS will need to obtain a license from Imperas.  These will be provided free of charge by Imperas for OpenHW members working on CV32E40P.

3. Using [core-v-isg](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-isg) for 32-bit cores:

- Neo is not sure how much effort it would be to port the NVIDIA instruction set generator (now core-v-isg) for 32-bit architectures.<br>
ACTION: **Neo** to investigate and report back at the next meeting.

4. Next meetings:

- team agreed to maintain weekly meetings at this timeslot (9AM Beijing time).
- **Mike** to send out an Agenda 2 days ahead of time (with reminders of Action Items).

**OpenHW:** Mike Thompson <br>
**NVIDIA** Joe Xie, Neo Fang, Doris Yin, Eric Liang, Robert Liu, Wenjing Song

Notes:

Actions: Neo, Mike


Topics:
-------
1. Regular meetings:

- Mike has regular (typically weekly) meetings with several of the OpenHW Member
Companies that contribute engineering staff to CORE-V verification.
- It is possible that the new management team at OpenHW may want to modify that
meeting schedule in the future.
- In the meantime, Joe and Mike agree to hold weekly meetings on Thursdays, at
9:00A.M., China time (Wednesdays, 9PM EDT).<br>
ACTION: **Mike** to book these meetings.

2. Executable demo for core-v-isg

- Mike reports that the core-v-isg has Makefiles to compile it using
Cadence Xcelium (xrun) and Metrics dsim.<br>
ACTION: **Neo** to create a "vcs.mk" to support compiling with Synopsys VCS.
- Mike would like to create an "executable example".  This would require a simple
testbench and/or program  that would compile the isg, and run it to generate a hexfile.
- Neo agreed that he could do this for VCS.<br>
ACTION:  **Neo** to create example testbench and add ability to vcs.mk to compile
and run it.


3. Use of core-v-isg for CORE-V verification

- Current core-v-isg is targets RV64 cores and will require some effort to port
to RV32 architectures.
- The strategy for CV32E40P was defined prior to NVIDIA joining OpenHW and is
currently planned to use the Google instructon set generator (rsicv-dv)
- Mike recommends we deploy core-v-isg on the CV64A, an RV64 ISA core.
- Use of core-v-isg for future CV32 cores is to-be-determined.

4. CORE-V Overview for NVIDIA team

- Joe requested a presentation for the team.<br>
ACTION: **Mike:** to create a set of slides and present in our next meeting.
